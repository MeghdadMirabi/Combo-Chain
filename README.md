# ABAC Based on Blockchain
## Implement access control in a simple iot system using ethereum smart contracts.

This post presents the code used for our paper **"Hierarchical attribute-based access control for IoT using blockchain and smart contracts"**, including the **APSC**, **SRMC**,Â **SAMC**,**OAMC**, **APMC**, **Oracle**, **JavaScript at the subject**, and **JavaScript at the object**.

## Steps to run the code.
1. setup three private Ethereum network.
2. Deploy the APSC and SRMC on chain1, SAMC and APMC on chain2, and OAMC and APMC on chain3.
3. Deploy oracle.
4. Register Subject and Object.
5. Add Subject/Object Attributes.
6. Add the required information for access control to the smart contracts, e.g., access control policies.
